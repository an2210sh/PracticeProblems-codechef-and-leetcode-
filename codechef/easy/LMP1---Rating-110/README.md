## Problem

### Protein Diet

You consume $X$ grams of protein daily. A balanced diet requires at least $Y$ grams of protein per day.

Determine whether your daily protein intake fulfills the recommended requirement. The daily protein intake is considered fulfilled if and only if $X$ is greater than or equal to $Y$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ - the grams of protein consumed daily and the minimum grams of protein recommended respectively.
### Output Format

Print `YES` if the daily protein intake meets or exceeds the recommended amount.
Otherwise, print `NO`.

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings `NO`, `no`, `No`, and `nO` will all be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
80 65

```

```
YES
```

### Explanation:

Since $X = 80$ is greater than $Y = 65$, daily protein intake is fulfilled.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
16 49

```

```
NO
```

### Explanation:

Since $X = 16$ is less than $Y = 49$, daily protein intake is not fulfilled.

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
10 10

```

```
YES
```

### Explanation:

Since $X = 10$ is equal to $Y = 10$, daily protein intake is fulfilled.

Determine whether the available seating is enough for everyone.

Print `YES` if all students can be seated; otherwise, print `NO`.

### Input Format
- The first line contains three integers $N$, $K$, and $P$.
### Output Format
- Print YES if there are enough chairs for all the people. Otherwise, print NO.
### Constraints
- $1 \le N,K,P \le 10^4$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output
